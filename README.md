# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Summary of Analysis

* Our analysis examined 15 Schools across the Local Area, and included average student scores in Math and Reading, as well as average overall scores. A passing score was 50 or better. The total student population amounted to 39,170 students and the total budget for the area schools was $24,649,428.00. The local area acheived an Overall Passing Average of 72.80%. According to the data, Independent Schools consistently outperform government schools. When considering scores by schools type, the Independent Schools outstripped Government schools in every category. We can also make some valuable conclusions/comparisons based on our data.

### Comparisons/Conclusions

* 3 out of 5 of the Top Performing Schools by % Overall Passing are Independent Schools, while 4 out of 5 of the Bottom Performing Schools are Government schools.

* There is also no apparent correlation between Total School Budget and Overall School Performance - the highest performing school in terms of Overall Performance (Griffin High School) had the third-smallest budget of the schools in the dataset. Conversely, the worst performing school (Hernandez High School) had the third-highest spend in terms of school budget. We can conclude that size of a school budget is not a reliable predictor of school performance.

* One element that is a reliable predictor of performance is school size. School size seems to have a direct impact on average student performance across the board. As the size of the school shrinks, the average student performance rises. 

* In order to maximize the effectiveness of the local areas expenditures, efforts should be made to implement two strategies: (1) To restructure schools to reduce sizes as much as possible, and (2) to adopt the methods that Independent Schools are using which are making them more successful than the Government Schools' educational program.
